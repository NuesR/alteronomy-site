# Examples of Alteronomies

This page presents a selection of alteronomies — both real and speculative — that embody one or more of the core principles of alteronomy. Each example includes commentary, critical reflection, and links to further exploration.

---

## Example 1: [Placeholder Title for a Web-Based Alteronomy]

**Description:** A brief description of the system. What is it? What problem does it try to solve?

**Link:** [Visit site](https://example.com)

**Commentary:**
- How does it express coherence or rooted justification?
- What are its strengths and limitations?
- Does it meet the criteria of human-scale design?

## Example 2: Embedded Video with Commentary

**Video:**
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**Commentary:**
- What does this video illustrate about designing alternative systems?
- Does it represent a genuine alteronomy or merely an interesting variation?
- How might the ideas be expanded or critiqued?
