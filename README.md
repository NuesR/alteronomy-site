# Alteronomy

**Alteronomy** is a field of study concerned with the systematic development, analysis, and critical reflection of deliberately constructed systems of order — so-called alteronomies. These systems are characterized by internal coherence, argumentative grounding, and accessibility to human cognition.

Alteronomy investigates not only the structural properties such systems must possess, but also why they often fail to gain traction in real-world contexts — despite their potential structural superiority. The starting point is a hypothetical, unprejudiced learner who has no knowledge of existing systems but possesses human cognitive capabilities.

Unlike speculative worldbuilding or conlangs, alteronomies are grounded in structured principles, and prioritize elegance, reflexivity, and human-scale complexity.

This repository hosts a minimalist, expandable website introducing the field of alteronomy and its foundational ideas. It is published via [GitHub Pages](https://yourusername.github.io/alteronomie-site/) and will evolve over time.

## Key Concepts

- **Coherence and Universality**: Alteronomies aim for internal consistency and universal applicability.
- **Human-Scale Design**: Systems must be realistically learnable and usable by humans without excessive abstraction.
- **Reflexivity**: Each system should contain structures for self-analysis and adaptation.
- **Rooted Justification**: Alteronomies must be based on arguments derived from their internal logic, not external conventions.

## Goals of This Website

- Introduce the philosophy behind alteronomy
- Provide examples and patterns
- Encourage discussion and experimentation
- Serve as a reference point for future projects and collaborations
