# Core Principles of Alteronomy

Alteronomy rests on a set of core principles that guide both the creation and evaluation of alteronomies — that is, consciously constructed systems of order.

These principles are not rules, but directional constraints. They sharpen the goal of creating systems that are not just alternatives, but *better* alternatives.

---

## 1. Coherence

An alteronomy must be internally consistent. Its elements should fit together without contradiction and form a comprehensible whole. Redundancy and arbitrariness are to be avoided.

## 2. Rooted Justification

Every part of an alteronomy must be justifiable *within* the logic of the system itself. It should not rely on external traditions, habits, or cultural defaults. The system must argue for itself.

## 3. Human-Scale Complexity

Alteronomies must be learnable, usable, and debuggable by human minds. This does not imply oversimplification — but it requires elegance and bounded complexity.

## 4. Reflexivity

A good system includes means to observe, describe, and critique itself from within. It should allow its own users to reflect on its structure and assumptions.

## 5. Frozen Scope

An alteronomy is published in a fixed version. This prevents endless tinkering and invites focused adoption. Improvements can be made in forks or successors.

## 6. Minimal Interdependence

Whenever possible, components of an alteronomy should be modular and loosely coupled. This makes the system adaptable and reduces cognitive overhead.

## 7. Hypothetical Universality

Design should assume a hypothetical learner with no exposure to existing systems — yet with human cognition. Systems should be approachable without inherited baggage.

> These principles are provisional. Alteronomy is a living field — but each alteronomy must, paradoxically, commit to temporary stillness.
