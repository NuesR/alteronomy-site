# Alteronomy

**Alteronomy** is a field of study concerned with the systematic development, analysis, and critical reflection of deliberately constructed systems of order — so-called alteronomies. These systems are characterized by internal coherence, argumentative grounding, and accessibility to human cognition.

Alteronomy investigates not only the structural properties such systems must possess, but also why they often fail to gain traction in real-world contexts — despite their potential structural superiority. The starting point is a hypothetical, unprejudiced learner who has no knowledge of existing systems but possesses human cognitive capabilities.

Unlike speculative worldbuilding or conlangs, alteronomies are grounded in structured principles, and prioritize elegance, reflexivity, and human-scale complexity.
